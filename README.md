This repository contains a src, tests, docs-skeleton with common lintering, developing and testing tools.  

It is focused to use the pyproject.toml to prevent a larger amount of boilerplate-files to configure the whole project. 

As stated [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for) [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/#rationale) is introducing the pyproject.toml. [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) adds the functionality for editable installs which makes the setup.py irrelevant. 

With [PEP 631](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/) it becomes easily to add optional-dependencies and the need for the setup.cfg is not relevant anylonger.
